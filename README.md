## 0x00. Fix my code
Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

Please download the repository <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge" >0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge</a> and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
